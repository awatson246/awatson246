# Hey there! 

I'm a passionate **PhD student** with a background in **robotics**, **mechatronics**, and **electrical engineering**. I specialize in leveraging **machine learning** and **data analysis** to solve complex problems and drive innovation. My work spans across **synthetic data generation**, **IIoT**, and **time series data analytics**. As your resident hippie-nerd, I’m always exploring new ways to blend **technology** and **sustainability** to create a positive impact.

🌱 **Currently learning:**  
I’m currently exploring the world of **explainable AI** and **AI for cybersecurity** to better understand complex datasets and improve model transparency. Additionally, I’m researching applications of AI to enhance **cybersecurity** defenses.

💻 **What I do best:**  
- Build and optimize **ML models** for predictive analysis and decision support.
- Explore **automated solutions** to enhance system efficiency and reduce human error.
- **Analyze data** to uncover meaningful patterns and insights that drive strategy.

📝 **Projects & Research:**  
I'm always working on something exciting. Here are a few highlights:
- **[A Comprehensive Approach to Evaluating Usability and Hyperparameter Selection for Synthetic Data Generation](https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/A_Comprehensive_Approach_to_Evaluating_Usability_and_Hyperparameter_Selection_for_Synthetic_Data_Generation/26339674?file=47819851)**: A deep dive into **synthetic data quality analysis** using **GANs**.
- (In Progress) **[Time-Series Tune-Up: Securing Time-Series Models with Unlearning](https://github.com/awatson246/forecast-unlearning)**: Analyzing the effectiveness of **AI-based defenses** in cybersecurity. 
- **[Renewable Energy Modelling](https://github.com/awatson246/Renewable-Energy-Project.git)**: Exploring the impacts of the **Energy Policy Act of 2005** on **renewable energy consumption**.

🎯 **Long-term goals:**  
I’m committed to applying my skills to create **ML-driven solutions** that make systems more efficient, safe, and sustainable. As I continue to grow my expertise, I aim to contribute to advancements in **ML ethics**, **sustainability**, and **cybersecurity**.

✨ When I’m not considering dropping my computer into a lake or reading the never-ending steam of new research articles, I enjoy running marathons, dancing, and experimenting with new vegan recipes.
